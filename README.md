# The Analysing Programme for Scanning Electron Microscopes
@@ ðŸ‘€ This app is a main product of the project realised by the students of the [Faculty of Physics](https://physics.itmo.ru/en) (ITMO University, Saint Petersburg):
[Kliment Semushev](https://github.com/dyed-eye) and [Mikhail Shulga](https://github.com/SHULGA-Mikhail) @@

The app is designed to propose an analysis of different objects from a picture and find those with a required size.

At the moment our project is at the active stage of creation. We already realised:
+ Graphical User Interface for better experience
+ different algorithms for object recognising using the [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) library for python
+ objects' size calculation is still being developed
+ the data analysis is generally composed

We are looking forward to any tips and suggestions related to the topic. You can contact with [Kliment Semushev](https://t.me/dyedeye) for any questions

The main problem related is to recognise objects despite a low contrast between the objects and the background
